                    <p>However, the real secret to finding unique photos is to avoid stock agencies altogether. Stock can lack spontaneity and emotion, which are vital if you want your readers to connect with the story (and your brand). Here are my go-to libraries for eye-catching and original shots:</p>

The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="TopFoto (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.topfoto.co.uk/" target="_blank">TopFoto</a> archive is made up of millions of original negatives and hardcopy prints from a number of thriving 20th century historic British press agencies from the glory days of Fleet Street (c. 1905 – 1969). They cover a vast range of topics and are usually willing to digitise images. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Mirrorpix (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.mirrorpix.com/" target="_blank">Mirrorpix</a> is one of the largest intact historical and contemporary British photographic press collections. A vast amount of images have not been scanned digitally so it is always worth asking the archivists to look through their prints and negatives.
