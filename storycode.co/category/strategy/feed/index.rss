                    <p>Ask the Northern Irish doctor for her best advice for a budding entrepreneur and she simply poses two questions: “Are you addressing an unmet need? Do you truly know the inner workings of the mind of the person you are trying to target?” Ticking these two boxes has been a constant in her business. From day one, Bunting set out to solve a problem she knew only too well was causing misery for countless women – problem skin. While chronically stressed working as a junior doctor in hospital she found herself plagued by spots and the associated anxiety becoming her own target audience.  “I’ve been there. I’ve cancelled dates because of bad skin – I have a real personal insight,” she recalls. <br><br>Bunting also saw that lack of dermatology expertise in GPs, combined with a feeling in women that they “shouldn’t complain”, meant many were suffering in silence simply because they didn’t know where to go. “In the UK it’s not common to go to a dermatologist for what people think is a beauty problem”, she explains, “but acne is the most common skin problem in our society. It’s a really pervasive issue that is generally not handled very well and causes huge amounts of distress and scarring. Fixing it makes such a big difference to people’s lives.” <br><br>The life-changing possibility of achieving great skin informed the thinking behind her private dermatology practice, which she opened a decade ago, and still drives her brand.</p>

                            &ldquo;I understood women not only wanted medical solutions for skin problems but they wanted to take it further and enhance their skin. So I positioned it as a skincare clinic rather than just solving disease.&ldquo;

                    <p>This instinctive positioning worked leading to a natural interest from press without any concerted PR push.  Success followed in the form of work with skincare brands – including Dolce &amp; Gabbana’s skincare launch – as well as world travel and even a TV show, TLC’s ‘Extreme Beauty Disasters’, in which Bunting helped fix beauty treatments gone wrong. <br><br>As her personal brand grew, Bunting’s social media presence emerged organically in response to an issue she witnessed time and again in her patients – women following bad advice from amateur beauty bloggers. “I thought that was a good time to take to YouTube and develop the channel as a place where you could come for good advice from a place of proper skin knowledge.” <br><br>Again, her instinct was correct. Bunting’s wise, medically-informed advice, confident, friendly manner and recommendations for great, reasonably-priced products gathered a loyal following. She credits this to her empathy and integrity. “I think that’s what people like about me. The straightforwardness of how I demystify a lot of things around skincare and my integrity in what I recommend. I don’t encourage heavy-spending unless the way that the product is formulated genuinely leads to increased costs.” <br><br>While many brands try to retrofit community onto products, it was Bunting’s community that “naturally” led her to the idea of creating a skincare brand – something she had been mulling for years.  As well as continually hearing the same concerns from her online audience, she noticed many brands used in her practice were being discontinued despite consumers complaining. “It was a real call to action to do something about that myself – to make products that were even better, using the knowledge I’d accumulated by working with people over the last 10 years.” <br><br>The line itself is pure Dr Sam: sleek, simple and accessible. “The idea is that simplicity is luxury”, Bunting explains. “I wanted it to be a super-educated edit with no extraneous products. Simple, easy to use, easy to navigate – with supporting video content that leaves you with zero question marks about how to use everything correctly together. I knew I didn’t want to get bogged down in medical language. I wanted the tone of voice to be warm and empathetic so the consumer knows they’re in good, safe but also human hands.&#8221;</p>

                                                                            <p>Despite being courted by many major brands to launch a range with them, Bunting was determined to go it alone in producing her skincare line. It’s a self-funded effort and she’s carefully scaling the operation – launching one product at a time and asking her community for feedback as she goes.  The intermediate price-point is her in-person skincare clubs – small gatherings in beautiful settings where people can talk, ask questions and leave with a goody bag. “I think real life events are quite sexy right now,” Bunting twinkles. <br><br>These elements are mutually beneficial. A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Facebook group (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/188297935057501/" target="_blank">Facebook group</a> created for attendees of events has “snowballed” rapidly gathering 12,752 members to date, with a monthly engagement of 29,000. It’s such an active audience that Bunting regularly uses the group to ask for feedback or conduct surveys to ensure communications are grounded in genuine consumer insights. <br><br>She also confesses she’s at full capacity at her clinic. Giving content away for free has only helped her business. “Selling direct to consumer makes it more affordable for the buyer but, more importantly, it helps us control the customer journey. It’s the way Apple works &#8211; I remember reading an article about one of the key marketers at Apple years ago on a plane and some of their premise was exactly what I wanted to do. I’ve built an uncluttered website without multiple options so it’s very clear what you should take for your concern. I want the shopper to feel confident they are being taken care of.” <br><br>Now that she’s firmly in e-commerce, is there a danger in giving so much of her expertise for free on social media? “I don’t think so,” Bunting replies, explaining she views her audiences as different complementary segments of her business – ultimately enabling her to help as many people as possible. “The clinic is our high-end offering – one-on-one, bespoke, aspirational, but still good value for money. The skincare range and content represent a diffusion line. You can get a quasi-clinic feel by watching the videos and reading the copy. It has the same feel and flow as a patient who walks out of my office with their bespoke skincare plan.”  </p>

                    <p>Looking back it would be easy to dismiss Bunting’s success as luck. But truly understanding her audiences and taking the time to learn from every step has laid the foundations of her brand. “It’s a bit of rambling route,” she admits, “but looking back there’s nothing I’ve done where I think ‘gosh, I wish I hadn’t done that’. It was all just a really good immersion in all parts of the market place.” <br><br>She has also faced challenges frequently pushing her comfort zone and grappling with topics she knew nothing about.  “I’m a doctor,” she laughs, “I have zero training in entrepreneurship. I can barely write an Excel spreadsheet! I could easily have become discouraged with the idea of building the business &#8211; but I’ve learned how to break tasks down step by step and avoid the anxiety that comes from being truly out of your comfort zone.  I’m naturally quite anxious and quite ‘type A’ so I’ve really had to embrace the ‘feel the fear and do it anyway’ approach to business life.” <br><br>She also credits respecting this anxiety as part of her success. “We worked really hard to minimise our costs in the early days to minimise the anxiety of a massive monthly spend. We were very lucky we were profitable within the first month. We’ve never had any debt. I think it would have been very difficult if we’d gone in all guns blazing with a new team and a big PR budget before we knew what we were meant to become.” <br><br>Is she proud of what she’s achieved? Here, pragmatic Dr Sam kicks in. “I’m Irish – so I’m not prone to being overly sentimental. But I couldn’t be happier with where we are. We’ve made the decision not to go into bricks and mortar at this point as we want to control the customer experience from end to end for a longer period of time. Once the brand is more established, we’ll revisit this”. <br><br>She adds that the kindness of others has been a big help in building the brand. “One of the things along the way that has been a real joy is the readiness of almost complete strangers to help me with different facets of my business. Sometimes it’s been overwhelming how generous people can be because they like to see others doing well. There’s a chain of people that I’m very grateful to for giving me the right introductions”. Ultimately, however, Bunting’s success rests on one thing – her desire to solve a real problem well.</p>

                    <p>We don’t just think in stories. We act in stories as well. We could wake up each morning and contemplate our smallness in an infinite universe but that would result in overwhelm and paralysis so we set goals and embark on journeys to achieve them. Each of these journeys is a story that narrows the world to a manageable scale and helps us avoid the existential abyss.<br><br>People have stories about their working lives: where they are going and how they are going to get there. These stories provide purpose, meaning and motivation. When a leader proposes change, people fear they are going to lose a story they may derive considerable comfort from and this can thrust them into a state of existential distress or at least acute ambivalence. </p>

                    <p>Adrift without a story map, people feel lost and discombobulated and may decide it is safer to do nothing than to move forwards. This is the resistance leaders often encounter when they propose a new strategy. The best way to prevent this is to provide people with a good story to replace the one they are losing. But what makes a good story?<br><br>Thinkers from Aristotle to the American mythologist Joseph Campbell have observed a universal  pattern underlying enduring stories. This pattern is the source code of  story – story DNA – and it mirrors the journey we go on when we try to change something in our lives.<br><br>At the start of a good story, life throws down a gauntlet challenging the hero to embark on an adventure. Cautious of change (as we all tend to be), the hero balks at first but then commits to the journey enduring many trials before finally emerging transformed and with a treasure or insight that will benefit the wider community. This pattern can be seen in stories from <em>The Odyssey</em> to <em>Jaws</em>.<br><br>Nobody is really sure why good stories involve people on change journeys but it may be because change is an important part of our survival as a  species. For better or worse, we are built for restless questing and stories help us do it. They explore the conflict between our need for change and our fear of change helping us set sail. They have been called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-21/edition-12/mind-s-flight-simulator" target="_blank">flight simulators</a> for life because they enable us to visualise and prepare for change in a safe virtual setting.<br><br>Effective leaders therefore say in one form or another: “We are headed to a new  destination. It won’t be easy – we’ll have to weather storms and slay dragons – but the prize will be worth the quest and we will be transformed by the journey.”<br><br>Leading change <em>without</em> a story is like leading an expedition without a map: your team will feel lost, fearful and mutinous. Lead with a story so people don&#8217;t lose the plot.</p>
